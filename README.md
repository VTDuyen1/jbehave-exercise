Implement a test case to search for a specific keyword on the Google home page using jBehave.
1. Create new Maven Project
2. Add all required dependencies to project
3. Create required JBehave story in the package
4. Create the required Java class in the package
5. Use at least the “Given, Then, When” annotations in story
6. Write a scenario using JBehave
7. Implement a test case to open the Google home page and search for the keyword ”JBehave”
8. If the results include the string “What is JBehave?” , the test case is successful. And failed otherwise

**HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT (Guidance for IntelliJ, MacOS)**
1. Click pom.xml set to make the project as a Maven project and download all dependencies
2. Run GoogleSearchStories
3. Chromedriver version 118


Due to time constraints, the exercises have not been perfected. Here are some points I would like to further improve:

1. Identify and configure settings for different operating systems: MacOS, Windows, Linux.
2. Establish a page-object structure for the project.
3. Review and enhance the project reports.
4. Develop parallel test cases to speed up execution and save time.
5. Set up configurations for various environments: production, staging, testing..
